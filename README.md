# Image-segmentation-with-Pytorch
Hurricane Harvey was a devastating category $4$ hurricane in the area of Texas and Louisiana in August $2017$. It caused more than $100$ deaths, catastrophic flooding and $125$ billion dollars in damage, according to the National Hurricane Center. In this context, AI can be deployed to develop better ways to monitor and evaluate ground conditions before, during and after such events, for humanitarian assistance. The timeliness of response that these solutions can provide is clearly vital in these contexts. </br> </br> 
This project consisted in the deployment of deep learning models to develop an accurate dense segmentation mask for post-flood aerial imagery data. The area concerned is the one of Houston, Texas which was affected by the hurricane. Data was provided on the platform engine.granular.ai, in the form of high-resolution drone images, exploring ground conditions. </br> </br> 
The shape of the images incentivized to try different techniques for data preprocessing and augmentation. This has been combined with different architectures and training procedures. The best model was able to provide a dice score equal to $74.8$%. The repo includes the final presentation of the results with literature review.
